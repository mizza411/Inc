## 2026-07-02 — “I'll pay to..” survey (Phase A) in Problem Identification Tool

**What we did**
- Added `ill_pay_to_v1` questionnaire (WTP, urgency, payment model, email) to both `web/data/` and `data/questionnaires.json`.
- Extended `questionnaire.js` with `email`/`short_text` types, `show_if` branching (2 rules), `?survey=` URL override, and `ref` capture on save.
- Kept `general_problems_v1` intact; dashboard reads both survey shapes without breaking older responses.

**Why it matters**
Strategy 3 can now share one flexible hosted survey instead of Google Forms, with conditional pricing questions and per-distributor tracking hooks—without forking the whole app.

**Intuition analogy**
Like swapping a paper comment card for a Typeform-style flow on your own domain: same questions as the Google Form, but you control branching, branding, and who gets credit for each reply.

## 2026-06-27 — Agent-orchestrated business idea formulation run

**What we did**
- Ran Strategies 4–7, 9, 11–15 without the interactive master runner (blocked on `input()` prompts).
- Pulled live Nairametrics/BusinessDay RSS headlines, World Bank Nigeria indicators, and OWID internet trend CSV.
- Applied each strategy’s prompt logic (news problems, niche combos, trending startup adaptation, personal problems from repo docs, GUEMF filter).
- Wrote consolidated output to `business_ideas_agent_run_20260627.md`.

**Why it matters**
The strategy scripts are designed for human-in-the-loop CLI sessions; an agent can substitute for ChatGPT Vision/manual paste steps by fetching public feeds and APIs, then producing the same Prompt 1a→1b idea hooks—except where sites block bots (Cloudflare on full articles).

**Intuition analogy**
Like running a Bloomberg terminal scrape plus a focus group in one pass: each “strategy” is a different lens on the same market, and the agent is the analyst who runs all lenses before the investment committee picks three names.
